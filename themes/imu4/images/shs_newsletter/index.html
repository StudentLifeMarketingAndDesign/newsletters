 <p style="color: #FFF;">Ingredients<br />
½ cup brown sugar<br />
1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />
1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg<br />
1 tsp ground cloves<br />
1 cup raisins or currants<br />
8 large Granny Smith apples, cored<br />
¾ cup frozen orange juice concentrate, defrosted<br /></p>

<p style="color: #fff;">Preparation<br />
1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, and mix until well combined. Fold in the raisins. Spoon as much of the mixture as possible into the cores of the apples. Drizzle 1-1/2 tablespoons of orange juice concentrate into each apple.<br />
2. Place four of the apples on a microwavable plate and place in a microwave oven set on high for 8 minutes. Remove the apples and cover them with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining apples and serve at once with the sauce.<br />

<p>You can see and hear references to sex in commercials, tv shows, movies and on the radio.  If sex is a common part of our culture, why aren’t we talking about it more? So in the words of Salt-n-Pepa “Let’s talk about sex baby…”</p>
<p>Regardless of your sexual orientation, gender, or sexual history; applying safe sex practices to your life are important to your overall health and safety. The 3 keys to safer sex have been identified as ways to improve your sexual health. </p>
<ol style="font-size: 12px;">
<li><b>Use Protection Consistently and Correctly</b><br />
52% of UI students report using a condom mostly/always during vaginal intercourse (NCHA). Condoms and other barrier methods (e.g. dental dams) are an effective way in preventing STIs and pregnancy.
<li><b>Get Tested!</b><br />
If you are sexually active, it is important to get tested for STIs. By the age of 25, 1 in 2 sexually active people will have an STI (CDC). The best way to know if you have an STI is to get tested! Make your appointment today at Student Health.</li>
<li><b>Consent is Sexy!</b><br />
Communication is key to any relationship. When engaging in any type of sexual activity, consent must be freely and affirmatively communicated between both partners. Are you asking for consent?</li>
</ol>

        <h3 style="color: #98D119;">Tips for Fall Fitness</h3>
<p>Take advantage of the amazing fall weather! The crisp air, pumpkin and apple picking, and crunch of leaves underfoot make it a great time to get outdoors. The fall air yields lower humidity levels, which makes exercising outdoors easier when compared to working out in the hot and sticky days of summer.</p>

<p>Here are some tips to stay active this fall: </p>
<ul style="font-size: 12px;">
<li><b>Mix It Up</b>: Walking, hiking, bicycling, running, frisbee, flag football, tag, etc.</li>
<li><b>Be Creative</b>: Discover park trails for a change of scenery, incorporate walking in between classes or during phone calls, go pumpkin-picking, take your pet for a walk, etc. </li>
<li><b>Plan Ahead</b>: Because days shorten in the fall, you may find yourself exercising in fading light. Wear clothing with reflective tape if possible.  To avoid temptation of skipping a workout because of the darkness, have a backup plan such as exercise DVDs, a walk around the mall, or a group exercise class at the CRWC.</li>
<li><b>Stay Hydrated</b>: Cooler temperatures may cause you to neglect hydrating regularly. Drink plenty of water each day – about half of your body weight in ounces.</li>
</ul>

    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: #FFF;"><b>Q:</b> <b>During the end of the day, when I remove my shoes and socks and just sit on my table, I always smell a foul odor, and that odor is coming from my feet.  I have a very sweaty pair of feet.  Even if I don’t walk much, just spend the day wearing shoes and socks, my feet sweat.  The sweating and smelling is worse when I run or do sports. Do you know any remedy for this?</b></p>
    <p style="font-size: 12px;"><b style="color: #FFF;">A:</b> There are more than 250,000 sweat glands in your foot.  The odor may be from excessive perspiration of these sweat glands, which may also explain why the sweating and smelling is worse when you are physically active.  </p>

<p style="font-size: 12px;">Though it can sometimes be impossible to eliminate foot odor completely, there are some things you can do to minimize it:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 12px;">
<li>Change your shoes daily to let each pair air out</li>
<li>Dry your feet after you bathe </li>
<li>Choose shoes and socks made of natural materials</li>
<li>Wear the right socks (some cotton and wool socks help keep feet dry by absorbing moisture; moisture-wicking athletics socks can also help)</li>
<li>Change your socks often</li>
<li>Take your shoes and socks off when possible to let your feet air out</li>
<li>Try applying antiperspirants at bedtime to the soles of your feet</li>
</ul>
